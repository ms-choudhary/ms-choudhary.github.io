## Why you should read research papers

- To keep up to date with latest developments in your field
- Generally a great learning, enhances your system design skills, and help you become more creative problem solver 
- Do a literature survey of new field you're interested in

## Three pass approach

Instead of reading a research paper end to end, consider reading it in passes to grasp the most out of it. 

### First Pass

- Generally takes 5-10 mins
- Gives a high level overview of what it's about and helps you decide if it's really worth your time
- First, carefully read abstract & introduction
- Read section & sub-section headings, glance at figures, ignore everything else
- Read conclusion

### Second pass

- Should take about an hour or so
- Read much more carefully this time, highlighting what you think are the main points. Also free free to add comments/notes in the margin. 
- You can chose to ignore the proofs
- After this, you should be able to summarize what the paper is about

### Second and half pass

- Re-read your highlights from previous step, take hand written notes of what you think are the main points

### Third pass

- (Use your notes rather than paper itself)
- Virtually reimplement the paper, that is, making same assumptions as author try to recreate the work
- Identify and challenge each assumption in every statement

## Literature survey 

Some tips on finding important papers in a field:
- Start with public search engines (google research or arxiv), based on key-words find 3-5 recent papers
- From the references, find shared citations & repeated authors, these are key research papers & researchers in the area
- Go to the researchers website, find the conferences where they published their work
- Go to conferences website, it should contain list of important papers
- Iterate
